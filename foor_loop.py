#Using a for loop, write a program which asks the user to type a positive integer, n,
#and then prints the sum of the square of all numbers form 1 to n (including both 1 and n).
# For example if the user type 3, the answer should be ((3**2) + (2**2) + (1**2)) = 14 

# n=int(input("Enter a positive number : "))
# count=0
# for i in range (1,n+1):
#     count=(i**2)+count

# Write a program that asks the user for an input 'n' (assume that the user enters a positive integer) 
# and prints a sequence of powers of 10 from 10^0 to 10^n in separate lines. 
# For example if 'n' is equal to 4 then the output should look like the following:
        # 1
        # 10
        # 100
        # 1000
        # 10000

# n=int(input("Enter a number : "))
# for i in range(0,n+1):
#     print(10**i)
