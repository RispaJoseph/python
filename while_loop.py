# Write a program which prints the sum of numbers from 1 to 101 that are divisible by 5. 
# ( 1 and 101 are included) (Use while loop)
# n=0
# count=0
# while n<=100:
#     if n%5==0:
#         count=count+n
#     n=n+1
# print(count)





# Write a program using while loop, which asks the user to type a positive integer, n, 
# and then prints the factorial of n. 
# A factorial is defined as the product of all the numbers from 1 to n (1 and n inclusive).

# n=int(input("Enter a positive number : "))
# factorial=1
# while n>0:
#     factorial=factorial*n
#     n=n-1
# print(factorial)



# Write a program using while loop, which prints the sum of every third numbers from 1 to 1001 
# ( both 1 and 1001 are included)
# x = 1
# count = 0
# while x < 1001:
#     count = count +x
#     x = x + 3
# print(count)
